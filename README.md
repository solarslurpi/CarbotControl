# CarbotControl 
CarbotControl is a mobile app that uses mqtt to talk with the [Carbot](https://github.com/solarslurpi/carbot) service on the Raspberry Pi.  It is part of the Doctor Growbuddy experience I am evolving.  With CarbotControl, I explore react-native and expo for building an app that will run on both iOS and Android.

# UI

I did not want to spend too much time on the UI since this is a prototype.
